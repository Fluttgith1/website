Material Design is an open-source design system built
and supported by Google designers and developers.

The latest version, Material 3, enables personal,
adaptive, and expressive experiencesâ€”from dynamic color
and enhanced accessibility, to foundations for
large screen layouts, and design tokens.

{{site.alert.warning}}
  As of the Flutter 3.16 release, **Material 3 is
  enabled by default**. For now, you can opt out
  of Material 3 by setting the [`useMaterial3`][] flag
  to `false`. But be aware that the `useMaterial3`
  method and support for Material 2
  will eventually be deprecated according to
  Flutter's [deprecation policy][].
