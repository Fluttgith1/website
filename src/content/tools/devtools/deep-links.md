:::note
The deep linking validator was added to DevTools
in Flutter SDK 19. It currently works only for
Android, but will be expanded to cover iOS and
web in future releases.

The deep linking view validates the deep links
on your app.

You can open DevTools, click into the **Deep Links** tab,
and import a Flutter project that contains deeplinks.

This tool helps you identify and troubleshoot any errors
in your Android deep link setup,
from website configuration to Android manifest files.
DevTools provides clear instructions on how to fix any issues,
making the implementation process much easier.
