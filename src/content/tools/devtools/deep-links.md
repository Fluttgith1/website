:::note
The deep link validator was added to DevTools
in Flutter SDK 3.19. It currently works only for
Android, but will be expanded to cover iOS
in a future release.
:::

The deep link view validates any deep links
that are defined in your app.

To use this feature, open DevTools,
click into the **Deep Links** tab,
and import a Flutter project that contains deep links.

This tool helps you identify and troubleshoot any errors
in your Android deep link setup,
from website configuration to Android manifest files.
DevTools provides instructions on how to fix any issues,
making the implementation process easier.
