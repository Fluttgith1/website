### SafeArea

When running your app on the latest devices,
you might encounter bits of the UI being blocked
by cutouts on top of the device's screen.

You can fix this with the [`SafeArea`][] widget,
which insets its child widget to avoid intrusions
like notches and camera cutouts,
as well as operating system UI such as the status bar
on Android, or by rounded corners of the display.
The `SafeArea` widget allows you to enable or
disable padding on any of its four sides.

It’s generally recommended to wrap the body of a
`Scaffold` widget in `SafeArea` as a safe place to start,
but you don’t always need to put it this high in the
`Widget` tree.

For example, if you purposefully want your app to stretch
under the cutouts, you can move the `SafeArea` to wrap
whatever content makes sense,
and let the rest of the app take up the full screen.

Using `SafeArea` ensures that your app content won’t be
cut off by physical display features or operating system UI
and sets your app up for success even as new devices with
different shapes and styles of cutouts enter the market.
