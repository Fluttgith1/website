The Flutter SDK has the packages and command-line tools that you need to develop
Flutter apps across platforms. To get the Flutter SDK, see [Install][].

## What's in the Flutter SDK

* [Dart SDK][] (as of as of Flutter 1.21).
* Heavily optimized, mobile-first 2D rendering engine with
  excellent support for text.
* Modern react-style framework.
* Rich set of widgets implementing Material Design and iOS-style.
* APIs for unit and integration tests.
* Interop and plugin APIs to connect to the system and 3rd-party SDKs.
* Headless test runner for running tests on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
* [Dart DevTools][] for testing, debugging, and profiling your app.
* `flutter` command-line tool for creating, building, testing,
  and compiling your apps.

Note: For more information about the Dart SDK, see its
[README file][].

## `flutter` command-line tool

The `flutter` command-line tool is how developers (or IDEs on behalf of developers) interact with Flutter.
