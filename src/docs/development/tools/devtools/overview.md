## What is DevTools?

DevTools is a suite of performance and debugging tools
for Dart and Flutter. It's currently in preview release,
but is under active development.

## What can I do with DevTools?

DevTools supports inspecting the UI layout and state of
a Flutter app, diagnosing UI jank performance issues in
a Flutter app, source-level debugging of a Flutter or
Dart command-line app, and viewing general log and
diagnostics information about a running app.

We expect developers to use DevTools in conjunction with
their existing IDE or command-line based development workflow.
