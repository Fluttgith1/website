With Flutter's [animation library],
you can add motion and create visual effects
for the widgets in your UI.
One part of the library is an assortment of widgets
that manage animations for you.
These widgets are collectively referred to as _implicit
animations_, or _implicitly animated widgets_,
deriving their name from the
[ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget] class that they implement.
To learn more about implicit animations,
you can browse through the following set of resources.
