The `flutter` command-line tool is how developers (or IDEs on behalf of developers) interact with Flutter.

Here's how you might use the `flutter` tool to create, analyze, test, and run an app:

```terminal
$ flutter create my_app
$ cd my_app
$ flutter analyze
$ flutter test
$ flutter run bin/my_app.dart
```

You can also run [`pub` commands][] using the `flutter` tool:

```terminal
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter pub outdated
$ flutter pub upgrade
```

The following table shows which commands you can use with the `flutter` tool.
