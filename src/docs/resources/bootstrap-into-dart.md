New to the [Dart][] language?
We compiled our favorite resources to
help you quickly learn Dart.
Many people have reported that
[Dart is easy and fun to learn][].
We hope these resources make Dart easy for
you to learn, too.

[Language tour][]
: Your best introduction to the Dart language.
  Learn about Dart's features such as _strong types_,
  _closures_, _libraries_, _lexical scoping_,
  _top-level functions_, _named parameters_,
  _async / await_, and lots more.

[Library tour][]
: A good overview of Dart's powerful core libraries.
  Learn about Dart's support for collections, async,
  math, numbers, strings, JSON, and more.

[Intro to Dart for Java Developers][] codelab
: Use your Java knowledge to get up and running quickly with Dart.
  Learn about classes, constructors, parameters,
  and interfaces with examples from the Java Tutorial.

[Effective Dart][]
: Guides for style, authoring documentation, usage,
  and more.

[Asynchronous programming][] codelab
: Learn how to use Futures,
  which are used extensively in the Dart core libraries.
  Futures can be used instead of one-time callbacks.

[Asynchronous programming: streams][]
: Learn how to use `Streams`, which are used extensively
  in the Dart core libraries.
  `Streams` can be used instead repeating callbacks.
  For example, the [`File`][] class
  uses `Streams` to read bytes from a file.
