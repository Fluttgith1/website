title: Measuring your app's size
description: How to measure app size for iOS and Android.
---

By default, launching you app with  `flutter run`,
or by clicking the play button in your IDE
(as used in [Test drive][] and
[Write your first Flutter app][]),
generates a debug build of the Flutter app.
The app size is large due to the debugging
overhead.

To get a better sense of what an end-user actually
has to download for a Flutter app, try the following.

## Android

Run the following from the top of your Flutter project
to get the size of APK for 32-bit Android devices:

```shell
flutter build apk --target-platform=android-arm
```

For 64-bit Android devices, run the following:

```shell
flutter build apk --target-platform=android-arm64
```

As of Flutter 1.9, you can run the following to get 2 APKs,
one for 32-bit and one for 64-bit.

```shell
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

{{site.alert.warning}}
  Do not run `flutter build apk` directly in Flutter 1.9
  (and later), because it generates a fat APK with both
  32-bit and 64-bit binaries.
{{site.alert.end}}

## iOS

To get a rough idea of how large your release IPA is,
run the following:

```shell
flutter build ios && tar -zcf build/app.ipa build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app && ls -lh build/app.ipa
```

To measure an iOS app exactly,
you have to upload a release IPA to Appleâ€™s
App Store Connect ([instructions][])
and obtain the size report from there.
IPAs are commonly larger than APKs as explained
in [How big is the Flutter engine?][], a
section in the Flutter [FAQ][].
