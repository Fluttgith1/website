title: Continuous integration and delivery with Nevercode

permalink: /deployment/nevercode/

[Nevercode](http://nevercode.io/) is the first CI/CD for mobile that offers out-of-the-box support for building, testing and distributing Flutter apps. You are expected to set up your project just once to build it for both iOS and Android.

All you have to do is:
1. Connect your repo.
2. Click Save and start build.

Everything else will be done by Nevercode automatically!

Once you have added the app and run the very first build, you can take full advantage of the features and configuration options that we offer, including automatic code signing, testing on real devices, publishing artefacts to 3rd party services like email, Slack, Google Play and App Store and more.
