## Welcome to the next level of Flutter!

If you are new to Flutter, and have already worked
through [your first Flutter codelab][],
this section of the website is for you!

The goal here is to guide you through some next
steps of learning Flutter. It's not about teaching
you how to _program_, it's about teaching you
how Flutter works.

{{site.alert.note}}
  This first week experience is still a work
  in progress and we welcome your feedback!
  Please consider filling out the survey
  listed at the bottom of this page and on the
  new subject pages in this section.

As you might know, Flutter uses the [Dart language][].
If you have experience with other object-oriented
languages, like Java, C++, or Swift,
Dart should feel familiar to you.
As of this writing,
[Dart is one of the fastest growing languages][dart-lang],
in part, thanks to Flutter.

We suggest that you work through the
following subjects in the listed order.

1. [Widget fundamentals][]
: Learn about one of the primary building blocks
  of a Flutter application, `Widgets`. 
2. [Layout][]
: Flutter is different from other UI frameworks
  in that you create the layout programmatically.
  This allows you to compose widgets,
  Flutter's basic building blocks,
  to realize your own layout vision.
  It also facilitates designing a UI to
  optimize any screen where your app might be used.
3. [State management][]
: Learn how to manage state. xxx
4. [Handling user input][]
: Learn how to handle user input. xxx
5. [Networking and data][]
: Networking is a very large topic,
  so this section focuses on basic networking
  functionality, such as how to retrieve
  or submit data using HTTP,
  how to convert to and from JSON,
  how to use authentication, 
  how to implement asynchronicity, and more.
6. [Local data and caching][]
: Learn about local data and caching. xxx
