To add iOS as a Flutter app target for macOS, follow this procedure.

This procedure presumes you installed [Xcode][] {{site.appnow.xcode}}
when your Flutter getting started path began with macOS.

{% include docs/install/compiler/xcode.md
   target='iOS'
   devos='macOS'
   time="next" -%}

{% include docs/install/flutter-doctor.md
   target='iOS'
   devos='macOS'
   config='macOSDesktopiOS' %}

[Xcode]: {{site.apple-dev}}/xcode/
