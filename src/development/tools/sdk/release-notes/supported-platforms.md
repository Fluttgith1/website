## Supported platforms

As of the current release,
Flutter supports the following platforms:

|Platform|Version                       |Channels |
|--------|------------------------------|---------|
|Android | API 16 (Android 4.1) & above | All     |
|iOS     | iOS 9 & above                | All     |
|Linux   | Debian, 64-bit               | All     |
|macOS   | El Capitan (10.11) & above   | All     |
|Web     | Chrome 84  & above           | All     |
|Web     | Firefox 72.0 & above         | All     |
|Web     | Safari on El Capitan & above | All     |
|Web     | Edge 1.2.0 & above           | All     |
|Windows | Windows 7 & above, 64-bit    | All     |

All channels include master, beta,
and stable channels.

## How we define a supported platform

We define three tiers of support for the platforms on
which Flutter runs:

1. Supported Google-tested platforms
  are automatically tested at every commit
  by continuous integration testing.
1. Best-effort platforms, supported through community
   testing, are platforms we believe we support through
   coding practices and ad-hoc testing,
   but rely on the community for testing.
1. Unsupported platforms, which are platforms that
   might work, but that the development team
   doesn't directly test or support.

### Supported Google-tested platforms

|Platform|Version               |
|--------|----------------------|
|Android |Android SDK 19–30*    |
|iOS     |14-15                 |
|Linux   |Debian 10             |
|macOS   |El Capitan & greater  |
|Web     |Chrome 84             |
|Web     |Firefox 72.0          |
|Web     |Safari / Catalina     |
|Web     |Edge 1.2.0            |
|Windows |Windows 10            |

* Passing tests on Android SDK 19 also confers a passing result on SDK 20.
  This is because Android SDK 20 has additional support for Android Wear,
  but otherwise no new or deprecated API.

### Best-effort platforms

|Platform|Version             |
|--------|--------------------|
|Android |Android SDK 16–18   |
|Android |Android SDK 17      |

|Linux   |Debian 9 & below    |
|Windows |Windows 8           |
|Windows |Windows 7           |

### Unsupported platforms
