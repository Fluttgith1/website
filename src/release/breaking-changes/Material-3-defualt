## Summary

The Material library has been updated to match the 
latest Material Design spec. Changes include new components 
and component themes, and updated component visuals. 
As of this release, useMaterial3 is true by default.

## Background

Flutter's Material widgets now fully support Material 3 and, in Flutter 3.16, Material 3 is now the default style. 

The appearance of Material 3 components are primarily determined by the values for [ThemeData.colorScheme] and [ThemeData.textTheme].
ColorScheme makes it easier to create dark and light schemes so that your app is both aesthetically pleasing and compliant with accessibility requirements. 
To further customize the appearance of Material 3 components, add component themes to your ThemeData, such as [ThemeData.segmentedButtonTheme] or [ThemeData.snackBarTheme]. 

Additionally, Material 3 improves motion by using easing and duration tokens. This means that Material 2 curves have been renamed to include the word "legacy" and will eventually be deprecated and removed. 

Check out the [Material 3 gallery][] to test out all the new components and compare them with Material 2.


## Migration guide

Prior to the 3.16 release, the changes were "opt-in" using the useMaterial3 theme flag. As of this release, useMaterial3 is true by default.
You can still opt out of the M3 version of the Material library by specifying useMaterial3: false in your MaterialApp theme.
Note that Material 2 will eventually be deprecated and removed. 

Also, some of the widgets couldnâ€™t merely be updated, but needed a whole new implementation. 
For this reason, your UI might look a little strange when you see it running as Material 3. 
To fix this, manually migrate to the new widgets, such as NavigationBar.
