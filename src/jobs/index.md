## Our values

### Mentorship

Upon joining Google, you will be paired with a formal mentor,
who will help guide you in the process of ramping up, forging relationships,
and learning the systems you’ll need to do your job.
Your manager can also help you find mentors who can coach you
as you navigate your career at Google. In addition to formal mentors,
we work and train together so that we are always learning from one another,
and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

### Inclusion

Here on the Flutter team and at Google, we embrace our differences
and are [committed to furthering our culture of inclusion](https://flutter.dev/culture).
In addition to groups like the [Flutteristas](https://flutteristas.org/),
[Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)](https://diversity.google/commitments/)
are employee-initiated networks for supporting underrepresented employees
and their allies with shared values of creating belonging
across their communities and Google.

### Work-Life Balance

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance.
Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life
is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused
on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead,
we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and
well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.
