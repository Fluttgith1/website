## Our values

### Mentorship

Upon joining Google, you will be paired with a formal mentor, who will help guide you in the process of ramping up, forging relationships, and learning the systems you’ll need to do your job.  Your manager can also help you find mentors who can coach you as you navigate your career at Google. In addition to formal mentors, we work and train together so that we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

### Inclusion

Here on the Flutter team and at Google, we embrace our differences and are [committed to furthering our culture of inclusion](https://flutter.dev/culture).  In addition to groups like the [Flutteristas](https://flutteristas.org/), [Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)](https://diversity.google/commitments/) are employee-initiated networks for supporting underrepresented groups within Google and their allies. Together, we actively cultivate an environment that demonstrates our shared values and fosters a sense of belonging.

### Work-Life Balance

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life — both in and outside of work.
