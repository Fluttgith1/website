title: Flutter for Xamarin.Forms Developers

This document is meant for Xamarin.Forms developers looking to apply their
existing knowledge to build mobile apps with Flutter. If you understand
the fundamentals of the Xamarin.Forms framework then you can use this document as a
jump start to Flutter development.

Your Android (and iOS) knowledge and skill set are highly valuable when building with
Flutter, because Flutter relies on the mobile operating system for numerous
capabilities and configurations. Flutter is a new way to build UIs for mobile,
and is similar to how you create a single UI in Xamarin.Forms, that is used on multiple
platforms. 

This document can be used as a cookbook by jumping around and finding questions
that are most relevant to your needs.
