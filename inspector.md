## Flutter Widget Inspector

The Flutter framework uses Widgets as [the core building
block](https://flutter.io/widgets-intro/) for anything from controls (text,
buttons, toggles, etc.) to layout (centering, padding, rows, columns, etc.). The
Flutter Widget Inspector is powerful tool for visualizing and exploring Flutter
these Widget trees. It can be helpful when:

* Undestanding existing layouts
* Determining which source code produces a particular widget
* Diagnosing layout issues

For a demonstration of the Widget Inspector, please see the recent
[DartConf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIcmJNT9DNI).

## Get Started with the Inspector

The Widget Inspector is currently available in [the Flutter
plugin](https://flutter.io/ide-setup/) for Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA.
