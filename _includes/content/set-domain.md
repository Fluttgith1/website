**Setting the company domain**<br>
When creating a new app, some Flutter IDE plugins ask for an
organization name in reverse domain order,
something like `com.example`. Along with the name of the app,
this is used as the package name for Android, and the Bundle ID for iOS
when the app is released. If you think you might ever release this app,
it is better to specify these now. They cannot be changed once the app
is released. Your organization name should be unique.
