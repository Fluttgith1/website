If you would like to contribute to the Flutter project,
we’re happy to have your help! Anyone can contribute, whether you’re new to
the project or you’ve been around a long time, and whether you self-identify
as a developer, an end user, or someone who just can’t stand seeing typos.

[Contributing to Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
in the [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) repo.

We are also happy to accept your PRs to the
[Flutter website](https://github.com/flutter/website/) repo.
