Flutter helps you access system services and 3rd party SDKs.
For example, you can open files, connect to network sockets,
activate the keyboard, talk to Firebase, and more. Flutter
ships with some built-in services. In the future, we plan to make
it possible for developers to build their own services.

This document lists the existing services that either
ship with Flutter, or are available as an add-on.
We expect this list to grow.
If there's a service that you need for your app, please let
us know by [filing an issue][newissue]. Thanks!

_Note: we're still building out docs and examples. If you have
any questions, don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact/).
Doc contributions are also welcome. :)_
