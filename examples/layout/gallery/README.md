Examples referenced in
["Layouts in Flutter"](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout) that come from
the now-archived [Flutter Gallery](https://docs.flutter.dev/gallery).
They are mostly the same with a few updates to run standalone,
use new language features, and follow modern Dart/Flutter style.

These should eventually be updated, replaced, removed, or similar
as the layout documentation is rewritten.
