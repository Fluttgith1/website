# Implicit animations codelab examples

The code samples within this folder are used
within the [Implicit animations codelab][].

- `container1` -> `container5` are used for the
  steps of "Shape-shifting effect" portion.
- `container1` is also used for the runnable starter sample and
  `container5` for the complete sample.
- `container6` is an extra step that showcases specifying a
  non-default animation curve.
- `opacity1` -> `opacity5` are used for the
  steps of "Fade-in text effect" portion.
- `opacity1` is also used for the runnable starter sample and
  `opacity5` for the complete sample.
- The severity of `missing_required_argument` is ignored manually
  in the [`analysis_options.yaml`](analysis_options.yaml) file since the
  diffing infrastructure currently can't handle the `ignore` for it.
