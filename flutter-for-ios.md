This document is meant for iOS developers looking to apply their
existing iOS knowledge to build mobile apps with Flutter. If you understand
the fundamentals of the iOS framework then you can use this document as a
jump start to Flutter development.

Your iOS knowledge and skill set are highly valuable when building with
Flutter, because Flutter relies on the mobile operating system for numerous
capabilities and configurations. Flutter is a new way to build UIs for mobile,
but it has a plugin system to communicate with iOS (and Android) for non-UI
tasks. If you're an expert in iOS development, you don't have to relearn everything
to use Flutter.

This document can be used as a cookbook by jumping around and finding questions
that are most relevant to your needs.

# Views 

## What is the equivalent of a `UIView` in Flutter?

On iOS, the majority of anything you may want to create in the UI is done using
view objects, which are instances of the `UIView` class.  These can act as
containers for other `UIView` classes, which form your layout.

In Flutter, the equivalent to this is a `Widget`. However, these have a few
differences to a  `UIView`. To start, widgets only exist for one frame, and on
every new frame, Flutter’s framework creates a new tree of widget instances.
In comparison, an iOS view is drawn once and does not redraw until it is
invalidated using `setNeedsDisplay()`.

Furthermore, unlike `UIView`, Flutter’s widgets are immutable, which allows
them to be very lightweight. By default, Flutter’s widgets are styled as
‘Material’ (i.e. Android themed), however you can use [Cupertino
widgets](https://flutter.io/widgets/cupertino/) to specify an iOS theme if you
require.

## How do I update `Widget`s?

To update your views on iOS you directly mutate them. In Flutter, widgets are
immutable and not updated directly. Instead, you have to manipulate the
widget’s state. This is where the concept of Stateful vs Stateless widgets
comes in. A `StatelessWidget` is just what it sounds like - a widget with no
state attached.

`StatelessWidgets` are useful when the part of the user interface you are
describing does not depend on anything other than the initial configuration
information in the widget.

For example, in iOS, this would be similar to placing a `UIImageView` with
your logo as the `image`. If the logo is not going to change during runtime,
you would use a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter.

If you want to dynamically change the UI based on data received after making an
HTTP call then you would use a `StatefulWidget`. After the HTTP call had
complete, you would tell the Flutter framework that the widget’s `State` has
been updated so it could update the widget.

The important thing to note here is at the core both stateless and stateful
widgets behave the same i.e. they rebuild every frame. The difference is that
the `StatefulWidget` has a `State` object which stores state data across
frames and restores it after being rebuilt.

If you are in doubt, then always remember this rule: if a widget changes (e.g.
because of runtime user interactions) it’s stateful. If the only time data
changes is at instantiation, it’s stateless. However, if a widget is reacting
to change, then the containing parent widget can still be stateless if it
isn’t itself reacting to change.

Let's take a look at how you would use a `StatelessWidget`. A common
`StatelessWidget` is the `Text` widget. If you look at the implementation of
the `Text` widget you'll find it subclasses `StatelessWidget`.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
new Text(
  'I like Flutter!',
  style: new TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
);
{% endprettify %}

"If you look at the code above, you might notice that the `Text` widget
"carries no explicit state with it. It renders what is passed in its
"constructors and nothing more.

But, what if you want to make "I Like Flutter" change dynamically, for example
when clicking a `FloatingActionButton`?

This can be achieved by wrapping the `Text` widget in a `StatefulWidget` and
updating it when the button is clicked.

For example:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  // Default placeholder text
  String textToShow = "I Like Flutter";
  void _updateText() {
    setState(() {
      // update the text
      textToShow = "Flutter is Awesome!";
    });
  }
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text("Sample App"),
      ),
      body: new Center(child: new Text(textToShow)),
      floatingActionButton: new FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _updateText,
        tooltip: 'Update Text',
        child: new Icon(Icons.update),
      ),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

## How do I layout my widgets? Where is my Storyboard? 

In iOS, you may use a Storyboard file to organise your views and set
constraints, or set your constraints programmatically within your view
controllers. In Flutter, you declare your layouts within code, by composing
the layout tree.

Here is an example of how you would display a simple widget on the screen and
add some padding to it.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return new Scaffold(
    appBar: new AppBar(
      title: new Text("Sample App"),
    ),
    body: new Center(
      child: new CupertinoButton(
        onPressed: () {
          setState(() { _pressedCount += 1; });
        },
        child: new Text('Hello'),
        padding: new EdgeInsets.only(left: 10.0, right: 10.0),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
{% endprettify %}

You can add padding to any widget, which mimics the functionality of
constraints in iOS.

You can view all the layouts that Flutter has to offer in the [widget
catalog](https://flutter.io/widgets/layout/).

## How do I add or remove a component from my layout?

In iOS, you would call `addSubview()` on the parent or `removeFromSuperview()`
on a child view to dynamically add or remove child views. In Flutter, because
widgets are immutable there is no direct equivalent to `addSubview()`.
Instead, you can pass in a function to the parent that returns a widget and
control that child's creation via a boolean flag.

For example, here is how you can toggle between two widgets when you click on
a `FloatingActionButton`:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  // Default value for toggle
  bool toggle = true;
  void _toggle() {
    setState(() {
      toggle = !toggle;
    });
  }

  _getToggleChild() {
    if (toggle) {
      return new Text('Toggle One');
    } else {
      return new CupertinoButton(
        onPressed: () {},
        child: new Text('Toggle Two'),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text("Sample App"),
      ),
      body: new Center(
        child: _getToggleChild(),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: new FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _toggle,
        tooltip: 'Update Text',
        child: new Icon(Icons.update),
      ),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

## How do I animate a Widget?

In iOS, you would create an animation by calling the
`animate(withDuration:animations:)` method on a view. In Flutter, animating
widgets can be done via the animation library by wrapping widgets inside an
animated widget.

In Flutter you use an `AnimationController` which is an `Animation<double>`
that can pause, seek, stop and reverse the animation. It requires a `Ticker`
which signals when vsync happens and produces a linear interpolation between
0 and 1 on each frame while it's running. You then create one or more
`Animation`s and attach them to the controller.

For example, you could have a `CurvedAnimation` to have an animation which
uses a curve to interpolate another animation. In this sense, the controller
is the "master" source of the animation progress and the `CurvedAnimation` is
tasked to modify the controller's linear output to a curve. Like widgets,
animations in Flutter work with composition.

When building the widget tree you then assign the `Animation` to an animated
property of a widget, such as the opacity of a `FadeTransition`, and tell the
controller to start the animation.

Let's take a look at how to write a `FadeTransition` that will fade in a logo
when you press a `FloatingActionButton`:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fade Demo',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new MyFadeTest(title: 'Fade Demo'),
    );
  }
}

class MyFadeTest extends StatefulWidget {
  MyFadeTest({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);

  final String title;

  @override
  _MyFadeTest createState() => new _MyFadeTest();
}

class _MyFadeTest extends State<MyFadeTest> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  AnimationController controller;
  CurvedAnimation curve;

  @override
  void initState() {
    controller = new AnimationController(duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 2000), vsync: this);
    curve = new CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeIn);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: new Center(
        child: new Container(
          child: new FadeTransition(
            opacity: curve,
            child: new FlutterLogo(
              size: 100.0,
            )
          )
        )
      ),
      floatingActionButton: new FloatingActionButton(
        tooltip: 'Fade',
        child: new Icon(Icons.brush),
        onPressed: () {
          controller.forward();
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

## How do I draw to the screen?

On iOS, you would use `CoreGraphics` in order to draw lines and shapes to the
screen. Flutter has a different API based on the `Canvas` class, with two
other classes that help you draw: `CustomPaint` and `CustomPainter`, the
latter of which implements your algorithm to draw to the canvas.

In this [popular StackOverflow
answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46241071/create-signature-area-
for-mobile-app-in-dart-flutter) you can see how to implement a signature
painter in Flutter.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class SignaturePainter extends CustomPainter {
  SignaturePainter(this.points);

  final List<Offset> points;

  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    var paint = new Paint()
      ..color = Colors.black
      ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
      ..strokeWidth = 5.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
      if (points[i] != null && points[i + 1] != null)
        canvas.drawLine(points[i], points[i + 1], paint);
    }
  }

  bool shouldRepaint(SignaturePainter other) => other.points != points;
}

class Signature extends StatefulWidget {
  SignatureState createState() => new SignatureState();
}

class SignatureState extends State<Signature> {

  List<Offset> _points = <Offset>[];

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new GestureDetector(
      onPanUpdate: (DragUpdateDetails details) {
        setState(() {
          RenderBox referenceBox = context.findRenderObject();
          Offset localPosition =
          referenceBox.globalToLocal(details.globalPosition);
          _points = new List.from(_points)..add(localPosition);
        });
      },
      onPanEnd: (DragEndDetails details) => _points.add(null),
      child: new CustomPaint(painter: new SignaturePainter(_points), size: Size.infinite),
    );
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

## How do I build custom widgets?

In iOS, you would typically subclass from `UIView` or a pre-existing view to
override and implement methods in order to obtain the desired behavior. In
Flutter building a custom widget is often accomplished not by extending but by
[composing](https://flutter.io/technical-overview/#everythings-a-widget)
smaller widgets.

Let's take a look at how to build a `CustomButton` that takes in a label in
the constructor. This is achieved by composing it with `RaisedButton`, rather
than extending `RaisedButton` and overriding and implementing new methods:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
class CustomButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String label;

  CustomButton(this.label);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new RaisedButton(onPressed: () {}, child: new Text(label));
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

Then you can use this `CustomButton` just like you would with any other widget:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return new Center(
    child: new CustomButton("Hello"),
  );
}
{% endprettify %}

# Navigation

## How do I navigate between pages?

In iOS, to travel between view controllers, you can use a
`UINavigationController` that manages the stack of view controllers to
display.

Flutter has a relatively similar implementation, using a `Navigator` and
`Routes`. A `Route` is an abstraction for a “screen” or “page” of an app, and
a `Navigator` is a [widget](https://flutter.io/technical-
overview/#everythings-a-widget) that manages routes. A route roughly maps to a
`UIViewController`. The navigator works in a similar way to the iOS
`UINavigationController`, in that it can `push()` and `pop()` routes depending
on whether you want to navigate to, or back from, a view.

Unlike iOS, you will need to pass in a `Map` of names of routes to the top
level `App` instance to declare all of your routes:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
void main() {
  runApp(new MaterialApp(
    home: new MyAppHome(), // becomes the route named '/'
    routes: <String, WidgetBuilder> {
      '/a': (BuildContext context) => new MyPage(title: 'page A'),
      '/b': (BuildContext context) => new MyPage(title: 'page B'),
      '/c': (BuildContext context) => new MyPage(title: 'page C'),
    },
  ));
}
{% endprettify %}
 
You can then navigate to a route by getting hold of the `Navigator` and
`push`ing one of the named routes.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/b');
{% endprettify %}

The `Navigator` class which handles all routing in Flutter can be used to get
a result back from a route that you have pushed on the stack. This can be done
by `await`ing on the `Future` returned by `push()`. For example, if you were
to start a ‘location’ route which lets the user select their location, you
could do:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
Map coordinates = await Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/location');
{% endprettify %}

And then, inside your ‘location’ route, once the user has selected their
location you can `pop()` the stack with the result:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
Navigator.of(context).pop({"lat":43.821757,"long":-79.226392});
{% endprettify %}

## Navigating to other apps

In iOS, in order to send the user to another application, you would use a
specific URL scheme. For the system level apps, there are specific schemes you
would use. In order to implement this functionality in Flutter, you would need
to create a native platform integration, or use an existing
[plugin](#plugins), such as
[`url_launcher`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/url_launcher).

# Threading & Asynchronicity

## Asynchronous UI

Dart has a single-threaded execution model, with support for `Isolate`s (a way
to run Dart code on another thread), an event loop, and asynchronous programming.
Unless you spawn an `Isolate`, your Dart code runs in the main UI thread and is
driven by an event loop. Flutter’s event loop is equivalent to the iOS main loop
— that is, the `Looper` that is attached to the main thread.

Dart’s single-threaded model doesn’t mean you are required to run everything as
a blocking operation that will cause the UI to freeze. Instead, in Flutter you
use the asynchronous facilities that the Dart language provides, such as
`async`/`await`, to perform asynchronous work. 

For example, you can run network code without causing the UI to hang by using
`async`/`await` and letting Dart do the heavy lifting:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
loadData() async {
  String dataURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
  http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
  setState(() {
    widgets = json.decode(response.body);
  });
}
{% endprettify %}


Once the `await`ed network call is done, you update the UI calling
`setState()`, which triggers a rebuild of the widget tree and updates the
data.

Here's an example of loading data asynchronously and displaying it 
in a `ListView`:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List widgets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    loadData();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: new Text("Sample App"),
      ),
      body: new ListView.builder(
          itemCount: widgets.length,
          itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int position) {
            return getRow(position);
          }));
  }

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return new Padding(
      padding: new EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
      child: new Text("Row ${widgets[i]["title"]}")
    );
  }

  loadData() async {
    String dataURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
    http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
    setState(() {
      widgets = json.decode(response.body);
    });
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

Refer to the next section for more information on doing work in the
background in Flutter and how it differs from iOS.

## How do you move work to a background thread?

Since Flutter is single threaded and runs an event loop (like Node.js), you
don't have to worry about thread management or spawning background threads. If
you're doing I/O-bound work, such as a disk access or a network call, then
you can safely just use `async`/`await` and you're all set. If, on the other
hand, you need to do computationally intensive work that keeps the CPU busy,
you want to move it to an `Isolate` as to avoid blocking the event loop.

For I/O-bound work, you can declare the function as an `async` function
and `await` on long-running tasks in the function:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
loadData() async {
  String dataURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
  http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
  setState(() {
    widgets = json.decode(response.body);
  });
}
{% endprettify %}

This is how you would typically do network or database calls, which are both
I/O operations.

However, there are times where you may be processing a large amount of data and
your UI could hang. In Flutter it is possible to take advantage of multiple CPU
cores to do long-running or computationally intensive tasks. This is done by
using `Isolate`s.

Isolates are separate execution threads that run and do not share any memory
with the main execution memory heap. This means you can’t access variables from
the main thread or update your UI by calling `setState()`. Isolates are true to
their name, and cannot share memory (e.g. in the form of static fields).

Let's see an example of a simple isolate and how you can communicate and share
data back to the main thread to update your UI.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
loadData() async {
  ReceivePort receivePort = new ReceivePort();
  await Isolate.spawn(dataLoader, receivePort.sendPort);

  // The 'echo' isolate sends its SendPort as the first message
  SendPort sendPort = await receivePort.first;

  List msg = await sendReceive(sendPort, "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");

  setState(() {
    widgets = msg;
  });
}

// The entry point for the isolate
static dataLoader(SendPort sendPort) async {
  // Open the ReceivePort for incoming messages.
  ReceivePort port = new ReceivePort();

  // Notify any other isolates what port this isolate listens to.
  sendPort.send(port.sendPort);

  await for (var msg in port) {
    String data = msg[0];
    SendPort replyTo = msg[1];

    String dataURL = data;
    http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
    // Lots of JSON to parse
    replyTo.send(json.decode(response.body));
  }
}

Future sendReceive(SendPort port, msg) {
  ReceivePort response = new ReceivePort();
  port.send([msg, response.sendPort]);
  return response.first;
}
{% endprettify %}

Here, `dataLoader()` is the `Isolate` that runs in its own separate execution thread.
In this isolate you can do more CPU intensive processing, for example parsing a big
JSON, or doing computationally intensive math such as encryption or signal processing.

A full example that you can run is below.

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List widgets = [];

  showLoadingDialog() {
    if (widgets.length == 0) {
      return true;
    }

    return false;
  }

  getBody() {
    if (showLoadingDialog()) {
      return getProgressDialog();
    } else {
      return getListView();
    }
  }

  getProgressDialog() {
    return new Center(child: new CircularProgressIndicator());
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
        appBar: new AppBar(
          title: new Text("Sample App"),
        ),
        body: getBody());
  }

  ListView getListView() => new ListView.builder(
      itemCount: widgets.length,
      itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int position) {
        return getRow(position);
      });

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return new Padding(padding: new EdgeInsets.all(10.0), child: new Text("Row ${widgets[i]["title"]}"));
  }

  loadData() async {
    ReceivePort receivePort = new ReceivePort();
    await Isolate.spawn(dataLoader, receivePort.sendPort);

    // The 'echo' isolate sends its SendPort as the first message
    SendPort sendPort = await receivePort.first;

    List msg = await sendReceive(sendPort, "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");

    setState(() {
      widgets = msg;
    });
  }

// the entry point for the isolate
  static dataLoader(SendPort sendPort) async {
    // Open the ReceivePort for incoming messages.
    ReceivePort port = new ReceivePort();

    // Notify any other isolates what port this isolate listens to.
    sendPort.send(port.sendPort);

    await for (var msg in port) {
      String data = msg[0];
      SendPort replyTo = msg[1];

      String dataURL = data;
      http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
      // Lots of JSON to parse
      replyTo.send(json.decode(response.body));
    }
  }

  Future sendReceive(SendPort port, msg) {
    ReceivePort response = new ReceivePort();
    port.send([msg, response.sendPort]);
    return response.first;
  }
}

## How do I make network requests?

Making a network call in Flutter is easy when you use the popular
[`http` package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/http). This abstracts
away a lot of the networking that you would normally implement yourself,
making it a simple way to make network calls.

You can use it by adding it to your dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify yaml %}
dependencies:
  ...
  http: '>=0.11.3+16'
{% endprettify %}

Then to make a network call, you `await` on the `async` function `http.get()`:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
[...]
  loadData() async {
    String dataURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
    http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
    setState(() {
      widgets = json.decode(response.body);
    });
  }
}
{% endprettify %}

## How do I show the progress of a long-running task in Flutter?

In iOS, you would typically use a `UIProgressView` while executing a
long-running task in the background. 

In Flutter this can be done by using a `ProgressIndicator` widget. You can
show the progress UI programmatically by controlling when it's rendered
through a boolean flag, and telling Flutter to update its state before your
long-running task starts, and hiding it after it ends.

In the example below, we break up the build function into three different
functions. If `showLoadingDialog()` is `true` (when `widgets.length == 0`)
then we render the `ProgressIndicator`. Alternatively, we render the
`ListView` with the data returned from a network call.

import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(new SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: new ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: new SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  SampleAppPage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _SampleAppPageState createState() => new _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List widgets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    loadData();
  }

  showLoadingDialog() {
    return widgets.length == 0;
  }

  getBody() {
    if (showLoadingDialog()) {
      return getProgressDialog();
    } else {
      return getListView();
    }
  }

  getProgressDialog() {
    return new Center(child: new CircularProgressIndicator());
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
        appBar: new AppBar(
          title: new Text("Sample App"),
        ),
        body: getBody());
  }

  ListView getListView() => new ListView.builder(
      itemCount: widgets.length,
      itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int position) {
        return getRow(position);
      });

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return new Padding(padding: new EdgeInsets.all(10.0), child: new Text("Row ${widgets[i]["title"]}"));
  }

  loadData() async {
    String dataURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
    http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
    setState(() {
