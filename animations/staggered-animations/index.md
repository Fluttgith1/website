**Terminology:**
If the concept of tweens or tweening is new to you, please see the
[Animations in Flutter tutorial.](/tutorials/animation/)
</aside>

Staggered animations are a straightforward concept: motion
is performed as a series of operations, rather than all at once.
The animation may be purely sequential, with one motion occuring after
the next, or it may partially or completely overlap.

This guide shows how to build a staggered animation in Flutter.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Where's the code?**<br>

This guide provides two staggered animation examples,
though only one is described here. The second, more complex example,
is available for your reference.

[basic_staggered_animation](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/master/_includes/code/animation/basic_staggered_animation)
: Shows a series of sequential and overlapping animations on a single widget.
  Clicking in the screen begins an animation that changes opacity, size,
  shape, color and padding.

[staggered_pic_selection](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/master/_includes/code/animation/staggered_pic_selection)
: Shows deleting an image from a list of images displayed in one of three sizes.
  This example uses two [animation
  controllers](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html):
  one for image selection/de-selection, and one for image deletion.
  The selection/de-selection animation is staggered. (To see effect this
  yourself, you may need to increase the `timeDilation` value.)
  Select one of the largest images&mdash;it shrinks as it displays a checkmark
  inside a blue circle. Select one of the smallest images&mdash;the large image
  expands before the small image shrinks. This staggered behavior is similar
  to that used by Google Photos.

The following video demonstrates a simple staggered animation
described in this guide:

<!--
  Use this instead of the default YouTube embed code so that the embed
  is responsive.
-->
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0fFvnZemmh8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

In the video, you see the following animation on a single widget,
which begins as a bordered blue square with slightly rounded corners.
In sequential order, the square:

* Fades in
* Widens
* Becomes taller while moving upwards
* Transforms into a bordered circle
* Changes color to orange

After running forwards, the animation runs in reverse.

## Basic structure of a staggered animation

<div class="whats-the-point" markdown="1">

<b> <a id="whats-the-point" class="anchor" href="#whats-the-point" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the point?</b>

* All of the animations are driven by the same
  [AnimationController](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html).
* Regardless of how long the animations lasts in real time,
  the controller's values vary between 0.0 and 1.0.
* Break the animation down into
  [Interval](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/Interval-class.html)s
  specified within 0.0 and 1.0.
* Create a [Tween](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html)
  for each property that animates in an interval.
  The Tween object specifies the start and end values for that property.
* The Tween produces an
  [Animation](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html)
  object that is managed by the controller.
{% comment %}
* Configure a widget with the animation's values.
{% endcomment %}
</div>

{% comment %}
XXX: rewrite
The app is essentially animating a Container whose decoration and size are
animated. The Container is within another Container whose padding moves the
inner container around and an Opacity widget that's used to fade everything
in and out.
{% endcomment %}

The following diagram shows the Intervals used in the
[basic_staggered_animation](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/master/_includes/code/animation/basic_staggered_animation)
example:

<img src="images/StaggeredAnimationIntervals.png" alt="Diagram showing the interval specified for each motion." />

Set up the animation as follows:

* Create an AnimationController that manages all of the Animations.
* Create a Tween for each property being animated.
* The Tween defines a range of values.
* The Tween's `animate` method requires the `parent` controller, and
  produces an Animation for that property.
* Specify the interval on the Animation's `curve` property.
* When the controlling animation's value changes, the new animation's
  value changes, triggering the UI to update.

The following code shows construction of the `width` and `borderRadius`
properties in the basic_staggered_animation example.
The `borderRadius` property controls the roundness of the square's corners.
Each tween builds a
[CurvedAnimation](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/CurvedAnimation-class.html),
specifying an eased curve.
See [Curves](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/Curves-class.html)
for other available pre-defined animation curves.

{% prettify dart %}
width = new Tween<double>(
  begin: 50.0,
  end: 150.0,
).animate(
  new CurvedAnimation(
    parent: controller,
    curve: new Interval(
      0.125, 0.250,
      curve: Curves.ease,
    ),
  ),
),

borderRadius = new BorderRadiusTween(
  begin: new BorderRadius.circular(4.0),
  end: new BorderRadius.circular(75.0),
).animate(
  new CurvedAnimation(
    parent: controller,
    curve: new Interval(
      0.375, 0.500,
      curve: Curves.ease,
    ),
  ),
),
{% endprettify %}

{% comment %}
The AnimatedBuilder (in StaggerAnimation) configures its widget using
these Tweens.
{% endcomment %}

### Custom animation widget

The final custom animation consists of a widget pair: a stateless
and a stateful widget.

The stateless widget specifies the Tweens,
defines the Animation objects, and provides a `build()` function
responsible for building the animating portion of the widget tree.

In our example, the build function creates an
[AnimatedBuilder](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/AnimatedBuilder-class.html),
a general purpose widget for building animations. The AnimatedBuilder
builds a widget and configures it using the Tweens' current values.
The example assigns the
`_buildAnimation()` callback function (which performs the actual UI updates)
to its `builder` property.
AnimatedBuilder listens to notifications from the animation controller,
and marks the widget tree dirty as values change.
For each tick of the animation, the values are updated,
resulting in a call to `_buildAnimation()`.

The code for the stateless widget, StaggerAnimation:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
[[highlight]]class StaggerAnimation extends StatelessWidget[[/highlight]] {
  StaggerAnimation({ Key key, this.controller }) :

    // Each animation defined here transforms its value during the subset
    // of the controller's duration defined by the animation's interval.
    // For example the opacity animation transforms its value during
    // the first 10% of the controller's duration.
    //
    // Most of the Intervals cause the animations' transforms to be
    // "staggered", i.e. to start one after another.

The stateful widget creates the controller, plays the animation,
and builds the non-animating portion of the widget tree.
The animation is kicked off when a "hit" gesture is detected anywhere
in the screen. The animation runs forwards, then backwards.

The code for the stateful widget, StaggerDemo:

<!-- skip -->
{% prettify dart %}
[[highlight]]class StaggerDemo extends StatefulWidget[[/highlight]] {
  @override
  _StaggerDemoState createState() => new _StaggerDemoState();
}

class _StaggerDemoState extends State<StaggerDemo> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  AnimationController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    _controller = new AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 2000),
      vsync: this
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  [[highlight]]Future<Null> _playAnimation() async[[/highlight]] {
    try {
      await _controller.forward().orCancel;
      await _controller.reverse().orCancel;
    } on TickerCanceled {
      // the animation got canceled, probably because we were disposed
    }
  }

  @override
  [[highlight]]Widget build(BuildContext context)[[/highlight]] {
    timeDilation = 10.0; // 1.0 is normal animation speed.
    return new Scaffold(
      appBar: new AppBar(
        title: const Text('Staggered Animation'),
      ),
      body: new GestureDetector(
        behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,
        onTap: () {
          _playAnimation();
        },
        child: new Center(
          child: new Container(
            width: 300.0,
            height: 300.0,
            decoration: new BoxDecoration(
              color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.1),
              border: new Border.all(
                color:  Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5),
              ),
            ),
            child: new StaggerAnimation(
              controller: _controller.view
