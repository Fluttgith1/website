## Writing Checklist

If your PR involves adding or updating writing content,
please check the following items before submitting your PR for review:

- [ ] Links use [kramdown link definition] syntax.
- [ ] If needed, links also use [kramdown reference link] syntax.
- [ ] Never link on the "here", "click here", or "this document".
Instead, use a phrase that describes what the reader will see.
See the google developer [style guide page on links] for more info.
- [ ] Use the present tense, and [avoid the future tense].
