If you’re new to Flutter or new to animation, consider starting with the built-in Flutter implicit widgets. Implicit animations are useful when you want to quickly add an animation without having to write a lot of animation code—because the implicit widgets framework already exists in one of the Flutter SDK libraries.

To add an animation to your app using Flutter’s implicit animation widgets:
1. Add a core Flutter animation widget such as `AnimatedOpacity`.
2. Add the widget (or object) that you want to animate.
3. Set the required parameters.
...and the Flutter framework handles the animation.

For example, add the `AnimatedOpacity` implicit widget, add a widget that you want to animate, and then change animation properties such as the `duration` to easily add an animation that automatically changes the transparency of an object.

## Implicit animation widgets
Shown below are examples of the Flutter implicit widgets, brief descriptions,  the library that contains each widget, and a link to the widget API doc.


<script>
imgOn = new Image;
imgOff = new Image;
imgOn.src = "images/AnimatedOpacity_blue.gif";
imgOff.src = "images/AnimatedOpacity_blue.png" height="42" width="42";
</script>

<a href="#" onClick="document.img.src=imgOn.src;">Play</a>
<a href="#" onClick="document.img.src=imgOff.src;">Stop</a>
<img src="images/AnimatedOpacity_blue.png" name="img" height="84" width="84">
